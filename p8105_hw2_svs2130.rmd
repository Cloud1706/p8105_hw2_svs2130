#Problem 1

The import and manipulation of the Mr. Trash Wheel Dataset.

```{r}
trashwheel = read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
                        sheet = 1, 
                        range = "A2:N408") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(-dumpster) %>%
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls))) %>% 
  rename("weight" = weight_tons, "volume" = volume_cubic_yards) #renaming columns to more reasonable variable names
```

The columns weight_tons and volume_cubic_yards were renamed to weight and volume since mentioning units seems superfluous. It can be mentioned once in the data description to suffice for it.
